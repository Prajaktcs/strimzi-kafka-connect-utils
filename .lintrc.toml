# Lakehouse Ops Connector Linter Configuration
#
# This file configures which lint rules are enabled and their severity levels.
# You can disable rules globally, override severities, or exempt specific connectors.

# Globally disabled rules (applies to all connectors)
# disabled_rules = ["naming-convention", "sensitive-data"]
disabled_rules = []

# Override rule severities
# Options: "error", "warning", "info"
[rule_severities]
# Example: Downgrade naming convention from warning to info
# naming-convention = "info"

# Example: Upgrade sensitive data detection to error
# sensitive-data = "error"

# Per-connector rule exemptions
# Format: connector-name = ["rule-id-1", "rule-id-2"]
[connector_exemptions]
# Example: Allow legacy-connector to skip naming convention checks
# legacy-connector = ["naming-convention"]

# Example: Allow test-connector to have hardcoded passwords (for testing only!)
# test-connector = ["sensitive-data"]
